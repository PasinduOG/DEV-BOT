  - **10+ protocol/stub errors** in short timeframe ‚Üí triggers cleanup
  - **5+ stale session closures** in short timeframe ‚Üí triggers cleanup
  - **10+ general session errors** ‚Üí triggers cleanup
- **Forced Session Cleanup**: Automatically removes corrupted files when thresholds are exceeded
- **Smart Restart Logic**: Restarts bot connection after cleanup
- **Console Override Monitoring**: Intercepts console output to detect session errors in real-time

#### Session Stability Checks
- **Command Deferral**: Bot warns users and defers command processing during session instability

npm run clear-sessions
# or
node clear-sessions.js

# Option 3: Full manual cleanup
rm -rf auth/session-*
rm -rf auth/sender-key-*
rm -rf auth/app-state-*
rm -rf auth/pre-key-*

# Option 4: Nuclear option (complete re-authentication required)
rm -rf auth/
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. QR Code Won't Display**
```bash
# Clear terminal and restart
clear && npm start
```

**2. Session Conflicts**
```
Error: Stream Errored (conflict)
```
- Close other WhatsApp Web sessions in browsers
- Use `!reset` command or `node clear-sessions.js`
- Restart the bot

**3. Static Sticker Creation Fails**
- Ensure image is valid (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Check image file size (< 10MB recommended)
- Verify Sharp installation: `npm list sharp`

**4. Animated Sticker Creation Issues**
- **Video Requirements**:
  - Recommended resolution: At least 512x512 pixels
  - Maximum duration: 5 seconds (longer videos will be trimmed)
  - Supported formats: MP4, WebM, GIF (others may work)
  - File size: Less than 8MB recommended
- **FFmpeg Compatibility**:
  - Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed: `ffmpeg -version` in terminal
  - The bot will automatically try multiple methods if one fails
  - Multi-tier fallback system: libwebp_anim ‚Üí webp ‚Üí GIF intermediate ‚Üí fluent-ffmpeg
- **Testing FFmpeg Compatibility**:
  - Run the included FFmpeg compatibility test script:
    ```bash
    npm run test-ffmpeg
    ```
  - This script will check which pad filter options work on your system
  - It creates test files in the temp directory to verify compatibility
  - Results help diagnose issues with animated sticker creation
  - Run the test script: `npm run test-ffmpeg`
- **Manually Creating Compatible Videos**:
  - Pre-process your video to 512x512 before uploading
  - With preserved aspect ratio: `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale='min(512,iw)':'min(512,ih)':force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,fps=12" -q:v 50 -compression_level 6 output.webp`
  - For square format (legacy): `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=512:512:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=512:512,setsar=1,fps=12" -q:v 50 -compression_level 6 output.webp`

**3a. Animated Sticker Creation Fails**
- Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed: `npm list ffmpeg-static fluent-ffmpeg`
- Try with shorter videos (< 10 seconds)
- Check video format compatibility (MP4 works best)
- For GIFs, ensure they're standard format

**3b. Aspect Ratio Preservation for Animated Stickers**
- The bot now preserves the original aspect ratio of videos when creating animated stickers
- Videos are no longer forced into a square format with black padding
- The maximum dimension is limited to 512px while maintaining the original proportions
- To test different aspect ratios, run: `npm run test-aspect-ratio`
- You can manually test other filter syntaxes with: `npm run test-ffmpeg`

**3c. Stickers Are Too Large and Cannot Be Sent**
- WhatsApp has a size limit of approximately 500KB for animated stickers
- The latest version optimizes stickers with these settings:
  - Reduced quality (`-q:v 50` instead of 80)
  - Lower frame rate (12fps)
  - Shorter duration (3 seconds max)
  - Increased compression (`-compression_level 6`)
- If stickers are still too large, you can further reduce quality in index.js (try `-q:v 40` or lower)
- Try direct upload with caption instead of reply method
- Check temp directory permissions in project folder

**3b. FFmpeg Video Processing Errors**
- **Error: "Invalid too big or non positive size for width '512' or height '512'"**:
  - This occurs with very small videos (less than 512px)
  - Solution: Try using a larger resolution video (at least 512x512)
  - Alternative: Try a different video source with higher resolution
  - Workaround: Direct upload method sometimes handles small videos better than reply method

- **Error: "No option name near '0x00000000'" or "No option name near 'black@0'" or "No option name near 'black'" or "Error parsing a filter description"**:
  - This occurs when your FFmpeg version doesn't support certain color format syntax in the padding filter
  - Solution: The bot now omits the color parameter entirely for maximum compatibility
  - Different FFmpeg versions have different requirements for color format: some support `color=0x00000000`, `color=black@0`, or `color=black`
  - If you're still seeing this error, update the bot to the latest version
  - Alternative: Try a different video or use the !reset command to clear any caches

**4. Bot Not Responding**
- Check console for error messages
- Verify WhatsApp connection status
- Try `!reset` to clear sessions

**5. Bad MAC Errors & Session Corruption**
```
Error: Bad MAC
Failed to decrypt message with any known session
Session error:Error: Bad MAC at Object.verifyMAC
Skipping protocol/stub message
Closing stale open session
```
- **Emergency Fix**: Use `npm run fix-bad-mac` for immediate aggressive cleanup
- **Quick Fix**: Use `npm run fix-sessions` for standard session recovery
- **Bot Command**: Use `!reset` command in private chat
- **Manual Fix**: `node clear-sessions.js` then restart
- **Nuclear Option**: Delete entire `auth` folder and re-authenticate

**6. Session Instability Warnings**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Session is currently unstable. Command processing is temporarily deferred.
Please wait for the session to stabilize, or try the !reset command.
```
- **Automatic Recovery**: Bot monitors and attempts auto-recovery
- **User Action**: Wait for stability or use `!reset` command
- **Manual Intervention**: Use `npm run fix-sessions` if automatic recovery fails

**7. Protocol/Stub Message Errors**
```
Skipping protocol/stub message: too many errors
```
- **Automatic Handling**: Bot counts these errors and triggers cleanup at threshold
- **User Action**: No immediate action needed - bot handles automatically
- **Manual Override**: Use `npm run fix-sessions` if issues persist

**8. Private Chat Commands Not Working**
- Ensure you're messaging the bot directly (not in a group)
- Check that the bot shows as "online" or "last seen recently"
- Verify the phone number used to authenticate the bot
- Try restarting the bot with `npm start`
- Check console logs for debugging information

**9. Video Responses Not Working**
- Ensure `src/chief.jpg` file exists in the project directory
- Check video file permissions and size
- Verify Sharp installation for video processing
- Monitor console logs for video sending errors

The bot continuously monitors session health through multiple mechanisms:

#### Console Output Analysis
- **Error Pattern Detection**: Monitors console output for session-related errors
- **Real-Time Counting**: Tracks error frequencies and patterns
- **Automated Response**: Triggers cleanup when error thresholds are exceeded

#### Session Stability Indicators
- **Protocol Error Counter**: Tracks "Skipping protocol/stub message" occurrences
- **Stale Session Counter**: Monitors "Closing stale open session" events
- **General Error Counter**: Tracks all session-related errors
- **Stability State**: Determines if session is stable enough for command processing

#### Intelligent Recovery Actions
- **Threshold-Based Cleanup**: Automatically triggers session cleanup at configured limits
- **User Communication**: Warns users during session instability
- **Command Deferral**: Temporarily postpones command processing during recovery
- **Automatic Restart**: Restarts bot connection after successful cleanup

#### Session Health Reporting
The `!status` command now provides comprehensive session health information:
- Current error counts for all monitored categories
- Session stability status
- Uptime and operational status
- System health indicators
